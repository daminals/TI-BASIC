# TI-BASIC
A collection of programs created in Algebra II and Precalc

Despite having recognition for the TI-Basic Programming language, github has poor langauge detection as the sample code are all in .8xp.txt format, not the actual .8xp. I assume this is because .8xp files are normally unreadable without some sort of interpreter. In the interest of langauge detection, I have placed a .8xp.txt file within this repo, however it is not meant as actual code, but more of a clone of this message.

Resources to view the actual .8xp code are:
TI Connect Software (Doubles as allowing you to send it to your calculator)
https://www.cemetech.net/sc/ Cemetech's IDE
